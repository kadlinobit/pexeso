# Pexeso - Memory Card Game
In each turn player flips 2 cards and looks for 2 indentical images. 
If different images are discovered, they are flipped back and it's next player's turn.
If 2 same images appear, player gets score point and continues to play in the next turn. 
The one who has the biggest score wins. 
If 2 players on the top positions have the same score, the one who flipped less cards wins.
